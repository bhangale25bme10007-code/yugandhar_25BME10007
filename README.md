# Smart Personal Expense Tracker

## Overview
Smart Personal Expense Tracker is a 100% Python-based application that helps users record their daily expenses, add received money, set weekly or monthly spending goals, and view their remaining balance. The goal of the project is to build a simple and beginner-friendly finance tool that runs locally without any complex sign-up or password system.

The project is implemented using Python and Streamlit for the interface, and SQLite for persistent storage of transactions and goals.
