# Smart Personal Expense Tracker – Problem Statement and Scope

## Problem Statement
Many students and young individuals struggle to track their everyday spending. They often do not know how much they have already spent in a week or a month, or how close they are to exceeding their planned budget. Most existing finance apps are complicated or require email signup and passwords. There is a need for a simple, offline, Python-based expense tracker that maintains a running balance and allows basic weekly and monthly spending goals.

## Scope of the Project
This project focuses on building a simple personal expense tracking system using 100% Python. The application allows users to:
- Add daily expenses  
- Add received money to increase balance  
- Automatically update remaining balance  
- Set weekly or monthly spending limits  
- View how much is spent and how much limit is remaining  

The project runs offline, requires no login password, and stores all data locally using SQLite.

## Target Users
- College students who want to control daily spending  
- Young working professionals  
- Anyone who wants a simple expense tracker  
- Beginners learning Python with real projects  

## High-Level Features
- Simple username entry (no email or password)  
- Add expenses (amount is subtracted from balance)  
- Add income/received money (amount added to balance)  
- Set monthly & weekly expense goals  
- View balance, total income, total expenses, and goal progress  
- Alerts when the user is close to or above the goal  
- Local database using SQLite for storing transactions
